# Portfolio / Blog

The intent is to redesign and rebuild my, as of writing, dead portfolio site using the techniques I've learned over the last two years at Jumpcloud. The goal is to create a responsive website using React or Vue with some key features.

1. Use favorite colors for design palette; teal, white, black, red
2. Provide user a theme changer / color picker
3. Blog showcase of whatever I want to write about
4. User can search through blog using filters via tags
5. User can download my resume
6. User is provided a means to smoothscroll to each section of main page in mobile (might scrap this; seems overengineered)
7. Potentially relaunch all projects previously hosted on Heroku for Projects section. Trepedeations over age of projects and their quality persist as I weight whether this is worth the effort.

This is an idea opportunity to leverage AI towards the functioning design as well. The initial setup stages will be focused on basical styling and primarily functionality. The second stage will be focused on implementing designs generated by AI. The final stages will be content creation & curation, getting the site live, and optimizing for lighthouse results.

Still undecided as of now whether I will implement Cypress tests during the redesign phase or after.
