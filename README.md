# Portfolio / Blog Revamp

Design Palette: Use favorite colors (teal, white, black, red).
Theme Changer: Include a theme changer or color picker.
Blog Section: Showcase written content with tag filters for search.
Resume Download: Provide an option to download my resume.
Smooth Scrolling: Consider for mobile, though potentially overengineered.
Project Re-launch: Evaluate relaunching projects previously hosted on Heroku.
The development will be in stages: initial setup, AI-generated designs, and content creation & optimization. The decision on Cypress testing integration is undecided, considering the significant layout changes.

This is an ideal opportunity to leverage AI towards the functioning design as well. The initial setup stages will be focused on basical styling and functionality. The second stage will be focused on implementing designs generated by AI. The final stages will be content creation & curation, getting the site live, and optimizing for lighthouse results.

Still undecided on testing / linting rules but that will come with time.
